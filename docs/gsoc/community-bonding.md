# Community Bonding

![](/images/community.jpg){ align=center }

The Community Bonding period lasted from May 20 to June 12, and it was a lot of fun and fruitful.
I had the wonderful opportunity to meet my mentor Sayam Kumar at an in-person meetup in Delhi on the first day of my community bonding periods. It was a fantastic day for me as we discussed aboutÂ the project, took some photos ðŸ“¸, and had a lot of fun. ðŸŽ‰


Unfortunately, my end-semester exams began on the 25th of May and lasted until the 13th of June, so I did not have enough time to interact with the community in this period. However I managed to find some time to participate in the PyMC Developer hackathon. I worked on the issue [#5581](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc/issues/5581) with [Maxim Kochurov](https://github.com/ferrine) and had the opportunity to meet the amazing PyMC community members, developers, and contributors. While working on this issue, I learned a lot about [Variational Inference](https://www.pymc.io/projects/docs/en/stable/api/vi.html), how tests works, and more about the PyMC code base.

## GSoCers Meet

In the final week of the community bonding period [Larry Dong](https://github.com/larryshamalama) hosted a Google meet, where I met all of the GSoC selected participants for this year. We got to know each other, talked about our projects, our interests, and had a lot of fun.


## What I learned?

I didn't have much time to learn about the projects because of my end-semester exam, so I spent the last week of community bonding period by reading [Aesara documentation](https://aesara.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). I learned about Aesara syntax, followed the beginner's [Tutorial](https://aesara.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/index.html), and created some small programmes to become more acquainted with Aesara.

Then I learned about Aesara [Ops](https://aesara.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extending/op.html), [Graph Structures](https://aesara.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extending/graphstructures.html), and Aesara's [Broadcasting](https://aesara.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/broadcasting.html) features.


## What is coming up next?

The Coding Period has already begun, and I am behind on my proposal timeline due to my university exam, but this week I will collect all of the Ops from Aesara that are used in multivariate implementations and will discuss the project's implementation with my mentor.

In addition, I am reading more about the various statistical distributions to gain a better understanding of them.


In my next blog, I'll discuss project implementation.

Thank you very much.ðŸ˜Š
